## Principle of operation

The operating principle of the TT-THERMO heater is very simple. Heater
simultaneously heats and circulates coolant throughout the engine.
It is suitable for heating most water-cooled engines, for example
cars and trucks, tractors, earthmovers and
work machines and microcars. The heater heats the engine evenly and quickly,
unlike traditional block heaters or other electric engine heaters.

The body of the heater is cast aluminum. The heater pump is operated without a carbon brush
electric motor. The heater has a separate heating element that is efficient and
heats the coolant quickly. The heater is resistant to glycol, which also lubricates
heater and prevents corrosion.

The resistor inside the heater heats the coolant to maximum of 50-60C°.
The thermostat controls the heating and maintains the temperature once
the maximum temperature is reached. The heater is usually not worth using for so long
on that the maximum temperature is reached. The pump circulates the coolant
continually. **NOTE! The heater must not be used dry.**

The heater warms up the engine of a normal passenger car in about ½ hours
-15C° - larger motors require a longer heating time of 40min-1h.
The heating time can be adjusted according to the bite of the frost, as the motor is uninsulated
the effective cooling capacity of the frost increases as the frost tightens. Do not use
heater for more than 2 hours at a time, this type of heater has the best efficiency
when the engine is warmed up to the starting temperature as quickly as possible,
then stop heating and start the engine. The optimal heating time for your car can be found out by
observing the engine start temperature at different
degrees of frost and according to which the heating time can be regulated. Advisable
temperature reached by the engine at which the engine can be started and stopped
preheating is +5 ... + 30 C °, from this higher temperature to the engine
preheating causes unnecessary energy loss, heat loss in the uninsulated
in the engine grow and cause unnecessary energy consumption.

All models operate at 220-240 V, 50 Hz.
Note. XC models are equipped with PTC resistors. A cold resistor may take flows above the rated current for a couple of seconds
and then equalize to the rated current: PTC resistance power
decreases as the temperature rises. The heater life is often reduced
by a repeated maximum load, i.e. heating to the maximum temperature, until the thermostat is switched off,
whereby the temperature of the components go higher than when heating is stopped at an engine temperature of +30C.

## Installation instructions

Before installing the heater, refer to your vehicle's owner's manual, if necessary,
or contact a service person who knows your vehicle. Use a qualified mechanic during installation
if necessary. NB! For vehicle use, we recommend
armored cable compatible heater models such as KLD and SLD. These models can be
connected to ready-made armored cable sets available on the market.

Models with a rubber cable can be used in vehicles if properly
installed. (Safety requirements are mentioned in standards SFS-5724 and
SFS-60335-1) The rubber cable must be covered with a mechanical cover, such as flexible armored hose
etc. which is securely attached at both ends, and the strain relief is
confirmed.

Carefully select the location of the heater in the engine compartment. Choice of installation location
depends on the vehicle and engine design. Typically the best place
for installation is the water hose between the engine and the interior heater cell.
The hoses must be evenly rising so that the air escapes, i.e. the so-called air pocket
may not form in the hose.

Newer VAG Group cars can be fitted with an oil filter
in the coolant circuit hose if the fluid circulation exists.
In cars with automatic transmission, a condenser can be installed in the fluid circuit when
lifting height, etc. technical values ​​are taken into account.

**NOTE! Do not install the heater less than 20cm from the fuel line or filters**
If there is air in the cooling system, for example a defective one
due to the cylinder head or insufficient ventilation, the heater may overheat.

Check the cooling system before installing the heater. Make sure that
the cooling system is clean of contaminants and does not leak.
The cooling system must be free of leak-proof chemicals as they may
clog the pump.

The heater is installed in a vertical position with the water outlet facing up.
If vertical installation is not possible, the heater will work well at 45 °
up to the mounting angle. **NOTE! The heater must not be installed horizontally.** Install
heater at least 20 cm below the minimum coolant level. Do not install
a heater in the vertical direction below the engine side of the slot. The lifting height is
0.6m, often the highest point on the liquid surface is the top surface of the heater cell. If
the heater is too low, or some other reason is preventing fluid circulation in the heater is running
overheated and the so-called. the thermostat “snippets”, which of course may cause the engine to warm up but
in the heater, the resistor seals are in constant overtemperature and
sealing materials age prematurely.

When working properly, the heater is only 5-10 degrees warmer than the one in the engine
the temperature of the liquid and then the liquid cools the heater while the heat is transferred
liquid. For example, when starting heating at -10 degrees, the heater is -5 ... 0 degrees
when on initially and the temperature slowly rises to the fluid and engine temperatures
with.

Inlet of the heater into the suction connection liquid supply from above the heater,
from the heater cell is the most recommended way. The heater must not be used in a car
in which case the direction of rotation of the car's water pump is irrelevant. If the hose
enters the suction connection from under the heater it may cause a lift height
impairment.

## Water circulation and installation direction of the heaters

We recommend using new water hoses for installation. This is how the heater can be
remove, for example, when replacing the vehicle.

Once the installation hose is selected, choke it on both sides of the installation site
with hose pliers so that no coolant leaks from the system when the water hose
cut. Cut the necessary piece from the hose and install the heater between the hoses.
Attach the heater and ground wire to the vehicle body. Add fluid if necessary
to the expansion tank of the cooling system until the tank is full.

On older vehicles and mopeds, make sure you have an interior heater
the valve is in the “open” position. If the valve is not open, the heater switches off
quickly because the coolant does not circulate.

In newer vehicles with air conditioning, the heater is very
usable because the coolant always also circulates inside the car
in the heater even when the vehicle engine is not running.

## After the installation
Before using the heater, make sure that the cooling system is full
liquid and that the water hoses do not leak. Let the vehicle's engine run for a moment to
any air that has entered the cooling system will be removed. **NOTE! After using the engine,
the heater will not start until the engine temperature has dropped
below the temperature set on the thermostat.**

The heater is connected to a single - phase, three - wire, grounded electrical outlet that
the voltage is 220-240V. The size of the circuit breaker must be 10A (<1800W
for heaters) or 16A (<3000W for heaters). **In addition to circuit breakers
the socket must be RCD protected. Older properties are possible
use a residual current device between the socket and the cable, if any
not electrified.**

**WARNING! Do not use an extension cord (extension cord) for connection, use only
the correct cable for the connector without an extension cable.** Extension cable
may interfere with fuse tripping in the event of a malfunction and
poses a fire risk!

**When the heater is on, it heats up. Do not touch the hot heater!**

**WARNING! Electrical work is only permitted with proper electrical installation permits
holders who are authorized to perform fixed 230V installations. heater
the plug must only be connected to a grounded socket and the heater is always on
shielded to the vehicle body.** Make sure there is no power cord
in clamps and tie it so that it does not rub against it.

**NOTE! It is forbidden to use the heater while the engine is running. No heater
may not be used in a defective car. The heater must not be used if there is a power cord
damaged. The heater heats up your vehicle quickly. Do not leave the heater on
unnecessarily, for example overnight.**

## Maintenance

The heater must be used on for a short time, even in summer, for about two months
intervals. This keeps the pump clean. If the pump does not start for a long time
after idle, it is possible that the cooling system contaminants
has accumulated in the pump mechanism. If the heater has a direct hose connection, disconnect
the input side (lower hose connection) and a water hose to pump the wheel spin
carefully from the connector hole using a screwdriver, for example. For the heater
to keep it in good condition, the coolant must be replaced in the vehicle manual
in accordance with.

**NOTE! The heater must not be opened.**

**NOTE! This appliance is not intended for children or other such persons
